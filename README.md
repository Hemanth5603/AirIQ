Beyond just monitoring air quality, Air IQ goes the extra mile by offering a unique doctor consultation feature. Users can connect with healthcare professionals directly through the app to seek advice and guidance on managing health issues related to air pollution exposure, ensuring proactive and personalized care.

In addition to its health-centric features, Air IQ serves as a comprehensive platform with a marketplace where users can access products and services aimed at reducing air pollution and promoting cleaner environments.

Powered by Gemini AI, the app's frontend boasts a user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates all its functionalities, providing a smooth and intuitive experience for users. Meanwhile, the backend, built using Node.js and Firebase, ensures robust performance, scalability, and data security, guaranteeing a reliable and efficient service at all times. Additionally, the app also boasts a feature to locate relevant places like parks with fresh air, clinics for mediciines, and hospitals nearby.
